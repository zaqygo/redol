## what is it for?
To explain why I wrote this script, I'll just give you my example. So, I have my own website, which, let's say, is located at www.site.com and I want my website to be displayed on this domain. I also have website hosting for clients. One of them is located at www.site.com/hosting/user1/index.html . The user wanted an address for himself user1.site.com but you're too lazy to worry about setting up your server/hosting. My script will help you in some way to solve this problem.
